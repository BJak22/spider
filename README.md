This project is an Solitairte Spider game

To the game choose "NEW GAME" option from menubar
There are 3 possible levels: beginner, intermediate and expert:
-beginner: all cards are in one color
-intermediate: deck is made out of cards in two colors (one red and one black)
-expert: deck is made of four different colors

You can find rules of the game on website:

the game automatically saves the best results at individual levels in a txt file

I also implemented a simple AI model in the game based on the logistic regression model, which can independently try to solve solitaire
